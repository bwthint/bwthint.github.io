Howdy!

I'm Brandon Win Thint, a recent graduate of Texas State University with a Master of Arts in Psychological Research, supervised by <a href='https://www.psych.txst.edu/faculty/psydirectory/krista-howard.html'>Dr. Krista Howard</a>. Previously, I received a Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin and worked as a research assistant for the <a href='https://labs.la.utexas.edu/dailyactivitylab/'>Daily Activity Lab </a> and <a href='https://sites.utexas.edu/projectlibra/'> Project LIBRA</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of health psychology, biostatistics, and social behavior. With over 7 years of experience coding in R, I am eager to learn novel ways to present complex findings using easily accessible and visually appealing methods. Currently, I am looking for a position as a research assistant to gain further experience in project management and publications prior to starting a PhD in either Biostatistcs of Clinical Psychology.

Outside of research, I am an avid hiker who plans on visiting every National Park in the United States! I also own two ungrateful cats, Rika and Chopper.
